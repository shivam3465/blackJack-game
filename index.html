        <h1>How to play BlackJack Game </h1>
        <ul>
        
          <li>First of all you should click on "START GAME" button, this will give you two cards randomly.</li>

          <li>Now if the sum of the digits of cards is less than 21 then you can add 
            a new card by clicking "NEW CARD" button, and this will be also given to you randomly.</li>

          <li>Now again if the sum of all the three cards is less than 21 , then again you can add a card as suggest in
            step 2.</li>

          <li>You can keep adding new cards until your sum either gets equal to 21 OR becomes greater than 21.</li>

          <li>So if your sum of the cards is equal to 21 then Wohooo! <i>You have got a blackJack! that means you have won the game. </i>
          </li>

          <li>And if your sum is greater than 21 then you have lost the game and you are out of it .</li>

          <li>Now you can play again by clicking the "RESTART" button</li>

        </ul>
